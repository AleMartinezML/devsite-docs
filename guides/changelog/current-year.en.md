In order to help you optimize your reconciliations, we made some changes in the generation of the date ranges for your scheduled reports. This change applies to both the Available Balance report and Account Balance report. After April 1st, 2020 to find your scheduled reports, you will have to search for them by one second less. 

 `Search` Filters | Actual Date | New Date |
--------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
begin_date  | 01/01/2020 00:00:00 | 01/01/2020 00:00:00
end_date | 02/01/2020 00:00:00 |  01/01/2020  23:59:59

Your new parameter will look as follows:

```
https://api.mercadolibre.com/account/bank_report/search?access_token={{access_token}}
	&created_from=schedule
	&user_id=290477154
	&begin_date=2020-01-01T00:00:00Z
